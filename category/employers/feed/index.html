<p>The best strategy to grow any business is to retain their most productive employee. Companies highly value employee retention because it costs time and money to replace employees, especially productive ones. Hence, retaining the top employees should be a priority.</p>



<p>Listed below are some tools to help you keep your very best talents and build the most efficient work force:</p>



<p><strong>Review Performance and Compensations regularly</strong></p>



<p>A well-compensated and engaging culture will make employees more likely to stay in their jobs long term. One of the most obvious ways to retain your top workers is to offer better-than-average bonus and excellent benefits. This is help your business face less disruption that comes from new hires having to learn new duties.</p>



<p><strong>Share Recognitions and Appreciation</strong></p>



<p>Employee appreciation is an important part of the retention strategy. It is crucial to acknowledge the top performances regularly. This can include publicly recognizing employees on their achievements, celebrating success, giving bonuses, and providing positive reinforcement.</p>



<p><strong>Provide growth opportunities</strong></p>



<p>Track employee productivity and identify who stands out to help set a clear path of advancement in their career and ongoing role. Invest in the high performing employees by providing them new opportunities and encourage them to learn new skills.</p>



<p><strong>Wellness Offerings</strong></p>



<p>Keeping employees fit is good business. Help employees feel supported by prioritising their wellbeing. Stress management programs, retirement planning services and reimbursement for fitness classes are some examples of what your business might consider providing to employees.</p>



<p><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong></p>



<p>A healthy work life balance is essential to job satisfaction. Encourage employees to set boundaries and utilise their vacation time. And if extra hours are necessary to wrap up a project, consider giving them extra time off to compensate.</p>



<p><strong>Flexible work arrangements</strong></p>



<p>Many businesses have prepared new policy to accommodate flexible working options. A compressed work week, flexi time, partial telecommuting options can help relieve stress of your team and boost employee retention.</p>



<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>



<p>Employee feedback and a good workplace communication can give you direct ideas, questions and concerns related to the challenges faced by your business. Proactively connecting with each team member on a regular basis can help ensure constructive and positive communication and help employees voice their concerns freely.</p>



<p>Many studies have shown, that the implementing of the above strategies in organisations have resulted in increased retention and stronger performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the employment market improves and candidates have more options, hiring the right person for the job has become increasingly difficult. After you have written a great job advert and shortlisted the applicants, schedule the formal interviews to get the best talent onboard.</p>
<p>The key to conducting a perfect job interview is in the preparation and approach. The few steps listed below will ensure both for best results.</p>
<p><strong>Basics</strong></p>
<p>Mobile to kept on silent or if expecting an urgent call then try to keep it in vibration mode. Avoid picking up calls or replying to messages in between the interview. Make the candidate comfortable by offering a glass of water.</p>
<p>Focus more on candidate qualities and try to figure out if he/she would fit into the requirement of your organisation or not. Conduct the entire interview in a simple and structured manner.</p>
<p><strong>1: Develop job-related questions by talking to employees about their current role</strong></p>
<p>.What are the candidate’s present responsibilities?</p>
<p>.What is the Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other Characteristics (KSAOs) required for their growth?</p>
<p>.Which of the above are you willing to train in a new employee?</p>
<p><strong>2: Ask the right types of questions by sticking to behavioural and situational interview questions</strong></p>
<p>For a situational interview question (“What would you do in…”), you can describe a major job requirement that the candidate will be doing on the job. And for a behavioural interview question (“Tell me about a time when you…”), ask the candidate how they handled situations that are likely to happen in the role you’re hiring for.</p>
<p><strong>3: Include a job-related test</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to predict a candidate’s future on-the-job performance is to give candidates a test of their on-the-job performance. For roles such as sales, job-related tests tend to be straightforward: get candidates to write you a mock cold prospecting email or conduct a mock sales call about your product or service.</p>
<p><strong>4: Conduct Structured Interview</strong></p>
<p>To conduct an interview that’s structured it is essential to have a template. Ask all the candidates the same questions, in the same order. If you don’t follow a structure, and instead conduct slightly different interviews for each candidate, you won’t be able to compare across candidates in a fair and objective way.</p>
<p><strong>5: Create an interview scorecard using a rating scale</strong></p>
<p>Create a simple rating scale (e.g., 1 = Bad, 2 = Average, 3 = Good, 4 = Great) and use it to rate your candidate’s answers during the interview. Record or take a few notes about candidate’s answers to justify the ratings you give. Using a rating scale ensures you can use candidate’s overall scores to compare them with each other instead of relying on gut instinct and first impressions.</p>
<p><em>Remember: our gut instincts can be very unreliable especially when it comes to candidates who are often masters at selling themselves. Use the data to hire instead.</em></p>
<p><strong>6: All things being equal, hire the candidate with the highest interview score</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations on your fantastic new hire!</p>

<p>A business is only as good as its people. With staff retention, productivity and engagement now ranking as the most topical concerns for modern-day business, identifying ways to improve and build job satisfaction for employees has become many company’s agenda to ensure continued success.</p>



<p>There is little doubt that great employees are an organization’s number one resource. Keeping workers happy helps strengthen a company in many ways, including:</p>



<p><strong>Lower Turnover</strong></p>



<p>Turnover can be one of the highest costs attributed to a business. Retaining workers helps create a better environment and makes it easier to recruit quality talent and save money. The bottom line: satisfied employees are typically much less likely to leave.</p>



<p><strong>Higher Productivity</strong></p>



<p>Irrespective of job title and pay grade, employees who report high job satisfaction tend to achieve higher productivity.</p>



<p><strong>Increased Profits</strong></p>



<p>Keeping employees safe and satisfied can lead to higher sales, lower costs and a stronger motivation to achieve targets and goals.</p>



<p><strong>Loyalty</strong></p>



<p>When employees feel the company has their best interests at heart, they often support its mission and work hard to help achieve its objectives. They may be more likely to tell their friends about their content, which helps spread goodwill.</p>



<p>When a company develops ways to deliver on respect, trust, safe work environment, good pay and opportunities&nbsp; to advance, it can easily satisfy employees – and help build a stronger, more stable, and profitable future.</p>

<p>With new hybrid work policies, it is crucial now more than ever. It is a strategic business objective because engaged employees lead to long-term employee retention, higher levels of productivity, and improved quality of work.</p>



<p>Often, companies miss the core issues related to employee engagement because executives assume engagement is directly linked to salary and compensation. For engaged employees who are happy and completely committed to their work, it’s more than just a pay check – it is the dedication towards their employers and role that makes them passionate about their work, which is often reflected in their outcomes.</p>



<p>Employee engagement can directly impact the below listed factors , which are important to run a good organisation.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Clear Communication</li><li>Building a strong Team</li><li>Employee trust in the company’s leadership</li><li>Employee relationships with the management teams/supervisors, and</li><li>Employee pride in being a part of the company.</li></ol>



<p>Finally, if you want to create effective engagement, you need to show the value of the employee experience. The employee experience affects everything from employee engagement and productivity to the their experience. By getting a feedback from your employees you can get the proof that the results will be worth the investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By creating standardized policies for the workplace, your organization can grow as an inclusive work environment, and join the ranks of the high-growth companies who are adapting hybrid work models and flexible workplace policies. To make the new policy a success to can use the below tips.</p>



<p><strong>1. Determine how employees will be expected to work and communicate at your organization</strong></p>



<p>While employees across many roles can work effectively outside the office, not all roles are best-suited for a fully remote work model. An important aspect of your workplace policies should be equality and inclusivity whenever possible. Your policy and processes should ensure everyone can feasibly work from home when necessary, no matter their role as a means of future-proofing your workplace.</p>



<p><strong>2. Provide the right tools for successful and secure work</strong></p>



<p>When working away from the office, your employees need the right tools to work securely and productively. For many employees, a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection might not be enough. Remote or hybrid employees need technology that makes them feel engaged and part of the team</p>



<p><strong>3. Establish clear rules about working from home</strong></p>



<p>Clearly communicate and document what&#8217;s expected when employees work remotely. Though most employees report being more productive working remotely, distractions abound when outside of the office. Set policies about when employees are expected to be available online, or if they can operate on a flexible schedule that&#8217;s built around their personal lives – for example, to accommodate a doctor&#8217;s appointment or child care.</p>



<p><strong>4. Plan time for collaborating and socializing</strong></p>



<p>Make sure your policy has guidelines for building in time for teams to be together outside for impromptu conversation and team-building. No matter what technologies you have at your disposal, human beings crave face-to-face connections. In your policy, build-in time every month, quarter, or year when you can virtually gather all team members for brainstorming, planning, and having fun.</p>



<p><strong>5. Clearly outline the legal rights that remote workers have</strong></p>



<p>Remote and hybrid workers are entitled to the same legal protections that in-office workers have. It&#8217;s important to support employees that are remote just as you would in-office workers. This means clearly discussing the training, benefits, and promotions that are available to them. If you don&#8217;t provide remote or hybrid workers with the same level of assistance as in-office workers, it could result in discrimination or disability-related workplace violations.</p>



<p><strong>6. Discuss compensation and benefits that employees will receive</strong></p>



<p>Perks can be specific to your company but should list anything that employees earn. Some companies give a stipend for equipment needed for work such as computer monitors or desk equipment. Others provide reimbursement for employees to use on office-related costs such as electricity.</p>



<p>Hybrid and flexible work is a beneficial aspect of the modern workplace. Enabling alternate work models shows your employees you care about their work-life balance and trust them to do what&#8217;s best for their productivity. By establishing a clear policy about remote, flexible and hybrid work, you ensure both your employees and your business reap the rewards.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you want your employees to work for a long tenure, and be happy while doing so, then the importance of work-life balance cannot be overstated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Work-life balance is the act of separating one’s work life from their personal life in such a way that neither encroaches on the other. It’s important to make it clear to employees that your organization understands the importance of work-life balance. Encourage employees to follow work-life balance best practices, and offer support and guidance if they need it. At the end of the day, an optimal work-life balance for your employees and you will be beneficial to your organization as a whole.</p>



<p>Below are some ways in which you can help your employee maintain a healthy and balanced life</p>



<p><strong>Flexible work hours</strong></p>



<p>Let employees work when it’s best for them (within reason, of course) instead of a hard 9-5.</p>



<p><strong>Ability to work from home</strong></p>



<p>If it’s a job or task that can be done from home, schedule times where the employee can do so.</p>



<p><strong>Personal time off</strong></p>



<p>Allow employees to take personal time when they deem it necessary. Of course, this would need to be monitored so it isn’t abused and it doesn’t affect the productivity of the workplace, but even knowing they are able to take it if needed can be a big positive.</p>



<p><strong>Have priorities straight</strong></p>



<p>If you want to attract good employees, and keep them, you can demonstrate your acknowledgement of the importance of work-life balance while setting achievable targets and goals.</p>



<p><strong>Competitive compensation</strong></p>



<p>One of the biggest stressors for employees is money. This helps them achieve their personal goals and meet the expectations and responsibilities of those around them.</p>



<p><strong>Comfortable office conditions</strong></p>



<p>If the employee is happy at work, they will be more productive and be looking forward to engaging more positively.</p>



<p><strong>Opportunities for professional growth and social connections</strong></p>



<p>If employees are able to grow in their job, and meet new people that have similar interests, they won’t feel stuck and will continue to be happy at work. They increase their social circle by engaging in meaning conversations necessary for their personal growth.</p>



<p>Since everyone is unique, however, belonging to a certain generation doesn’t automatically define one’s opinions on the importance of work-life balance. Employers should be as flexible as they can be in order to accommodate as many people as possible – after all, work-life balance isn’t just about the number of hours worked in the office. It’s also about creating a healthy, happy work environment in order to improve the overall work experience.</p>
