WFH often equals flexible hours, no daily commute and more productivity. However, with an abundance of distractions and a lack of inspiration and motivation, the dream can easily turn into a nightmare.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Luckily, there are a few small steps you can take to stay motivated and productive at home.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Designate a WFH Space<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>If you have been holding zoom meetings on the sofa and working from the comfort of your bed, stop. Right now. It might be a convenient way to work the WFH thing, but it certainly isn\u2019t the most productive. Not having a designated space to go to every day can lead to more procrastinating and less working. Choose a quiet space in your home and designate it as your\u00a0home office. This will help you establish an efficient work schedule and enable you to strike a healthy balance between work and home life. If you have a lot of video conferences and meetings, try to pick a place with a wall behind you. Nothing screams \u2018unprofessional\u2019 more than the view of an unmade bed or your family watching TV in the background.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Define Your Hours<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Once you have created a designated workspace, the next step is to make a realistic schedule. It is easy to get carried away when WFH, and many people find it hard to stop working. Not to mention, without a routine it is difficult to keep track of the hours you have actually worked. Create a clearly defined\u00a0work schedule\u00a0and stick to them. Not only will it help you structure your day better, but it can prevent burn out. Not to mention, having an actual start and end time to a workday will prevent you from getting distracted.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Style it Up<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>An aesthetically pleasing WFH environment is much more enjoyable to work in. Think about it \u2013 would you rather work in an uninspiring, drab office or a fun and dynamic work environment? A fun and functional home office can help inspire you during your work hours and boost productivity levels. Invest in your workspace in a way that speaks to you and sparks joy. This could include styling it up with leafy, green plants, creating a mood board or adding an essential oil diffuser. Basically, set up a place that you will feel good around.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Get Dressed<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>The start of a typical workday usually involves picking out an outfit, so why should working from home be any different? Making the effort to get dressed in suitable work attire can have a positive impact on your mentality and help you get into work mode.<\/p> \n                            \t<\/div>                                            \n                                                            \n                            \n                                                \n                        <div >\n                        \t                        \t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon elementor-accordion-icon-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n                        \t\t                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-opened\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t                        \t\t<\/span>\n                        \t                        \t<a class=\"elementor-accordion-title\" href=\"\">\n                        \t\t\n                        \t\t<span>Why is participation in employee engagement important ? <\/span>  \n\n                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\n                        \t<\/a>\n                        \t<\/div>                                                                 \n                            \n\n                                                                        \n                                <div class=\"accordion-desc\">                                    \n                               \t\t<p>Participation in employee engagement activity can have many benefits on the persons work life , listed below are 5 benefits to help you understand it better :<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Be Vocal <\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Have a clear target related your role defined by your manager.

It can be difficult to recognise when you need to focus on restoring your work-life balance, but there are signs you can be aware of.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Working for long periods without leaving your desk, checking emails when you should be present with family or friends, working weekends and eating lunch and\/or dinner at your desk are all signs that you don\u2019t have a good work-life balance. The problem is that lack of work-life balance over an extended period can lead to burnout, which can be dangerous, so it\u2019s important to recognise the symptoms ahead of time<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h2>5 tips for better work-life balance<\/h2><p><strong>Examine your situation <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Think about what your most important values are and how you want to spend your time. Once you\u2019ve established that, you can brainstorm small changes you can make that will have a big impact overall, such as forcing yourself to have a lunch break several times a week to exercise or chat with a friend.<\/p><p><strong>Manage other people\u2019s expectations <\/strong><\/p><p>Set boundaries by telling colleagues and clients when you will and won\u2019t be working, so they don\u2019t expect you to be available 24\/7. And be honest about your personal needs. Let your boss know which regular activities in your personal life are non-negotiable, whether it\u2019s putting your children to bed or doing yoga \u2013 whatever it is that really matters for you.<\/p><p><strong>Take care of your health<\/strong><\/p><p>Ensure you get enough sleep and exercise by including it in your routine, and make sure to reward yourself for your hard work by treating yourself every now and then. To do this you might need to delegate where you can, to free up your time for what\u2019s most important .Ask for extra resources if you need them.<\/p><p><strong>Learn to say no <\/strong><\/p><p>If you need to work late constantly just to get by, let your boss know that your workload is unsustainable. And if you tend to put other\u2019s needs before your own, learn to say no occasionally to new projects and extra commitments that will eat up your time and won\u2019t contribute to achieving your work or personal objectives .<\/p><p><strong>Plan fun activities for your personal time <\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0Get organised with family and friends, to ensure your personal time is fulfilling. Connecting digitally is important to a lot of us right now but try to get some down time away from that as well. Turn off electronic devices for a certain time period every evening or weekend so that you can give your full attention to the people and activities that are most important to you. Try and follow a daily routine that includes some time for yourself every week that\u2019s unrelated to your career.<\/p><p>Balance can feel tricky to achieve. But by trying these steps you can begin to find ways to make work feel less consuming and free up focus for the other parts of your life \u2013 even when times are challenging.<\/p> \n                            \t<\/div>                                            \n                                                            \n                            \n                                                \n                        <div >\n                        \t                        \t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon elementor-accordion-icon-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n                        \t\t                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-opened\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t                        \t\t<\/span>\n                        \t                        \t<a class=\"elementor-accordion-title\" href=\"\">\n                        \t\t\n                        \t\t<span>What is Job satisfaction and how to achieve it ? <\/span>  \n\n                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\n                        \t<\/a>\n                        \t<\/div>                                                                 \n                            \n\n                                                                        \n                                <div class=\"accordion-desc\">                                    \n                               \t\t<p>Job satisfaction is defined as the extent to which an employee feels self-motivated, content &amp; satisfied with his\/her job. Job satisfaction happens when an employee feels he or she is having job stability, career growth and a comfortable work life balance. This implies that the employee is having satisfaction at job as the work meets the expectations of the individual.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>If you always find yourself unsatisfied with your job, no matter where you go, there are a couple of things that you can do, apart from changing it.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Change Your Way of Work<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>It is understood that you would instead do something else than your job. However, there should be something about your job that you enjoy. To increase your job satisfaction, you can do more of the tasks that you like doing. Another way of doing this is by taking more of the tasks that you find fulfilling. This will increase your overall workload, but you will start enjoying your work. You will be happier, and you will want to go to work every day. And, if you cannot do either of two, then shuffle the existing ones and try and introduce an element that inspires you to work.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Work on Workplace Relationships<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>One great way of keeping yourself happy in your workplace is by nurturing relationships that matter. Research states that even short-term but quality relationships in the workplace can be motivating. So, take your time, build trust and relationships and make friends to increase the level of satisfaction in your job.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Think About Work in The Right Way<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>The way you think about your daily tasks and job also affects your job satisfaction level. Your perception about your work has an important role to play. It is not always possible to take it to be positive as it is different from building relationships. Your end goal should be looking for more meaning in your job.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Flexible Schedules<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Work-life balance is essential when it comes to job satisfaction. And, it is essential to fulfil all the responsibilities both in the personal and professional front. Flexible schedule arrangement can help you attend to other things in your lives like family. Many people resign due to work overload and due to lack of work-life balance. Things like\u00a0working from home\u00a0can also be helpful. Look for these factors when looking for a job.<\/p> \n                            \t<\/div>                                            \n                                                            \n                            \n                                                \n                        <div >\n                        \t                        \t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon elementor-accordion-icon-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n                        \t\t                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-opened\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t                        \t\t<\/span>\n                        \t                        \t<a class=\"elementor-accordion-title\" href=\"\">\n                        \t\t\n                        \t\t<span>Why is long term prospective important for an employee?<\/span>  \n\n                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\n                        \t<\/a>\n                        \t<\/div>                                                                 \n                            \n\n                                                                        \n                                <div class=\"accordion-desc\">                                    \n                               \t\t<p>Long-term employees demonstrate dependability to employers, leading to an increased chance of internal promotion and other benefits. Learning about the positive aspects of remaining with one employer for several years can help you when considering your career path.<\/p><p>Tenured employment provides many benefits to both the employee and the organization. Here are some of the most common reasons and benefits of being a long term prospective employee:<\/p><h3>Stronger expertise and knowledge<\/h3><p>Employees who have been with a company for several years have developed specific skills and extensive knowledge of how the company works and the way things are done. They have been there for the various changes that have occurred and have a deep understanding of the company&#8217;s policies and processes for doing things, which leads to an increase in productivity and fewer errors.<\/p><h3>Mentorship opportunities<\/h3><p>Tenured employees can use their knowledge to train and mentor other employees. They can help guide employees who may be less experienced by offering their knowledge and provide training and support to new hires.<\/p><h3>Job security and stability<\/h3><p>Employees with tenure have some measure of job security because there is less of a need for hiring and training new employees. Tenured employees tend to feel more stable in their careers and positions, resulting in increased motivation, productivity and commitment to the organization.<\/p><p>Organic Growth within a company is always preferred and adds value to your CV. This shows your commitment and Will to work in long term prospective while being loyal to an organisation.<\/p><h3>Attract and retain talent<\/h3><p>Organizations with a high number of tenured employees can attract talent and encourage employee retention. High employee turnover rates can make existing employees and candidates looking for a new job feel uncertain. However, when employees stay with a company for many years, that company can be viewed as having a secure work environment, which may be attractive to candidates who are looking for stability.<\/p> \n                            \t<\/div>                                            \n                                                            \n                            \n                                              \n                <\/div>              \n            <\/div>\n            <script>\n            jQuery( function() {            \t\n              \tjQuery(\"#accordion26064\").accordion();\n            \t} );\n            <\/script>\n        \t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-82a558e jltma-glass-effect-no elementor-widget elementor-widget-rs-button\" data-id=\"82a558e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"rs-button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rs-btn\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"readon rs_button\" href=\"https:\/\/www.careercomfort.co.in\/job-seeker-form\/\" >\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"btn_text\">Job seeker<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div> \r\n\t\t   \r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"has_ma_el_bg_slider elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-3f2872b elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default jltma-glass-effect-no\" data-id=\"3f2872b\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"has_ma_el_bg_slider elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-4533317 jltma-glass-effect-no\" data-id=\"4533317\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"has_ma_el_bg_slider elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element elementor-element-9e4da91 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default jltma-glass-effect-no\" data-id=\"9e4da91\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"has_ma_el_bg_slider elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-inner-column elementor-element elementor-element-20c513c frtxtjst jltma-glass-effect-no\" data-id=\"20c513c\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4f61751 jltma-glass-effect-no elementor-widget elementor-widget-rs-heading\" data-id=\"4f61751\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"rs-heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t        <div class=\"rs-heading style15 left \">\r\n        \t<div class=\"title-inner\">        \t\t      \t\t\r\n\t            <span class=\"sub-text \">Business Tie up<\/span><h2 class=\"title\"><span class=\"watermark\"><\/span>Do You Have Any Questions?<\/h2>\t\t\t\t\t        <\/div>\r\n\t                <\/div>\r\n\r\n        \t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-18da04e jltma-glass-effect-no elementor-widget elementor-widget-rs-accordions\" data-id=\"18da04e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"rs-accordions.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t            <div class=\"rsaddon-unique-accordion\">\n                <div id=\"accordion24503\" class=\"rs-addon-accordion accdstyle2\">                   \n                        \n                                            \n                        <div >\n                        \t                        \t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon elementor-accordion-icon-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n                        \t\t                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-opened\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t                        \t\t<\/span>\n                        \t                        \t<a class=\"elementor-accordion-title\" href=\"\">\n                        \t\t\n                        \t\t<span>How to conduct an effective interview ?

After you have written a great job advert and shortlisted the applicants, schedule the formal interviews to get the best talent onboard.<\/p><p>The key to conducting a perfect job interview is in the preparation and approach. The few steps listed below will ensure both for best results.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Basics<\/strong><\/p><p>Mobile to kept on silent or if expecting an urgent call then try to keep it in vibration mode. Avoid picking up calls or replying to messages in between the interview. Make the candidate comfortable by offering a glass of water.<\/p><p>Focus more on candidate qualities and try to figure out if he\/she would fit into the requirement of your organisation or not. Conduct the entire interview in a simple and structured manner.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>1: Develop job-related questions by talking to employees about their current role<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>.What are the candidate\u2019s present responsibilities?<\/p><p>.What is the Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other Characteristics (KSAOs) required for their growth?<\/p><p>.Which of the above are you willing to train in a new employee?<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>2: Ask the right types of questions by sticking to behavioural and situational interview questions<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>For a situational interview question (\u201cWhat would you do in\u2026\u201d), you can describe a major job requirement that the candidate will be doing on the job. And for a behavioural interview question (\u201cTell me about a time when you\u2026\u201d), ask the candidate how they handled situations that are likely to happen in the role you\u2019re hiring for.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>3: Include a job-related test<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>One of the best ways to predict a candidate\u2019s future on-the-job performance is to give candidates a test of their on-the-job performance. For roles such as sales, job-related tests tend to be straightforward: get candidates to write you a mock cold prospecting email or conduct a mock sales call about your product or service.<\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>4: Conduct Structured Interview<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>To conduct an interview that\u2019s structured it is essential to have a template. Ask all the candidates the same questions, in the same order. If you don\u2019t follow a structure, and instead conduct slightly different interviews for each candidate, you won\u2019t be able to compare across candidates in a fair and objective way.<\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>5: Create an interview scorecard using a rating scale<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>Create a simple rating scale (e.g., 1 = Bad, 2 = Average, 3 = Good, 4 = Great) and use it to rate your candidate\u2019s answers during the interview. Record or take a few notes about candidate\u2019s answers to justify the ratings you give. Using a rating scale ensures you can use candidate\u2019s overall scores to compare them with each other instead of relying on gut instinct and first impressions.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><em>Remember: our gut instincts can be very unreliable especially when it comes to candidates who are often masters at selling themselves. Use the data to hire instead.<\/em><\/p><p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p><p><strong>6: All things being equal, hire the candidate with the highest interview score<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>Congratulations on your fantastic new hire!<\/p> \n                            \t<\/div>                                            \n                                                            \n                            \n                                                \n                        <div >\n                        \t                        \t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon elementor-accordion-icon-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n                        \t\t                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-accordion-icon-opened\"><i class=\"fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n                        \t\t                        \t\t<\/span>\n                        \t                        \t<a class=\"elementor-accordion-title\" href=\"\">\n                        \t\t\n                        \t\t<span>How to create a remote, flexible or a hybrid work policy ?<\/span>  \n\n                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\t\t                        \t\n                        \t<\/a>\n                        \t<\/div>                                                                 \n                            \n\n                                                                        \n                                <div class=\"accordion-desc\">                                    \n                               \t\t<p>By creating standardized policies for the workplace, your organization can grow as an inclusive work environment, and join the ranks of the high-growth companies who are adapting hybrid work models and flexible workplace policies. To make the new policy a success to can use the below tips.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ol><li><strong> Determine how employees will be expected to work and communicate at your organization<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>While employees across many roles can work effectively outside the office, not all roles are best-suited for a fully remote work model. An important aspect of your workplace policies should be equality and inclusivity whenever possible. Your policy and processes should ensure everyone can feasibly work from home when necessary, no matter their role as a means of future-proofing your workplace.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong> Provide the right tools for successful and secure work<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>When working away from the office, your employees need the right tools to work securely and productively. For many employees, a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection might not be enough. Remote or hybrid employees need technology that makes them feel engaged and part of the team<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ol start=\"3\"><li><strong> Establish clear rules about working from home<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Clearly communicate and document what&#8217;s expected when employees work remotely. Though most employees report being more productive working remotely, distractions abound when outside of the office. Set policies about when employees are expected to be available online, or if they can operate on a flexible schedule that&#8217;s built around their personal lives \u2013 for example, to accommodate a doctor&#8217;s appointment or child care.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ol start=\"4\"><li><strong> Plan time for collaborating and socializing<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Make sure your policy has guidelines for building in time for teams to be together outside for impromptu conversation and team-building. No matter what technologies you have at your disposal, human beings crave face-to-face connections. In your policy, build-in time every month, quarter, or year when you can virtually gather all team members for brainstorming, planning, and having fun.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ol start=\"5\"><li><strong> Clearly outline the legal rights that remote workers have<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Remote and hybrid workers are entitled to the same legal protections that in-office workers have. It&#8217;s important to support employees that are remote just as you would in-office workers. This means clearly discussing the training, benefits, and promotions that are available to them. If you don&#8217;t provide remote or hybrid workers with the same level of assistance as in-office workers, it could result in discrimination or disability-related workplace violations.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ol start=\"6\"><li><strong> Discuss compensation and benefits that employees will receive<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Perks can be specific to your company but should list anything that employees earn. Some companies give a stipend for equipment needed for work such as computer monitors or desk equipment. Others provide reimbursement for employees to use on office-related costs such as electricity.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Hybrid and flexible work is a beneficial aspect of the modern workplace. Enabling alternate work models shows your employees you care about their work-life balance and trust them to do what&#8217;s best for their productivity.

Encourage employees to follow work-life balance best practices, and offer support and guidance if they need it. At the end of the day, an optimal work-life balance for your employees and you will be beneficial to your organization as a whole.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Below are some ways in which you can help your employee maintain a healthy and balanced life<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Flexible work hours<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>Let employees work when it\u2019s best for them (within reason, of course) instead of a hard 9-5.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Ability to work from home<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>If it\u2019s a job or task that can be done from home, schedule times where the employee can do so.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Personal time off<\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>Allow employees to take personal time when they deem it necessary.
