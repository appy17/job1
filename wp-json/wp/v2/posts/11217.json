To make the new policy a success to can use the below tips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Determine how employees will be expected to work and communicate at your organization<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While employees across many roles can work effectively outside the office, not all roles are best-suited for a fully remote work model. An important aspect of your workplace policies should be equality and inclusivity whenever possible. Your policy and processes should ensure everyone can feasibly work from home when necessary, no matter their role as a means of future-proofing your workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Provide the right tools for successful and secure work<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When working away from the office, your employees need the right tools to work securely and productively. For many employees, a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection might not be enough. Remote or hybrid employees need technology that makes them feel engaged and part of the team<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Establish clear rules about working from home<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly communicate and document what&#8217;s expected when employees work remotely. Though most employees report being more productive working remotely, distractions abound when outside of the office. Set policies about when employees are expected to be available online, or if they can operate on a flexible schedule that&#8217;s built around their personal lives \u2013 for example, to accommodate a doctor&#8217;s appointment or child care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Plan time for collaborating and socializing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your policy has guidelines for building in time for teams to be together outside for impromptu conversation and team-building. No matter what technologies you have at your disposal, human beings crave face-to-face connections. In your policy, build-in time every month, quarter, or year when you can virtually gather all team members for brainstorming, planning, and having fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Clearly outline the legal rights that remote workers have<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote and hybrid workers are entitled to the same legal protections that in-office workers have. It&#8217;s important to support employees that are remote just as you would in-office workers. This means clearly discussing the training, benefits, and promotions that are available to them. If you don&#8217;t provide remote or hybrid workers with the same level of assistance as in-office workers, it could result in discrimination or disability-related workplace violations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Discuss compensation and benefits that employees will receive<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perks can be specific to your company but should list anything that employees earn. Some companies give a stipend for equipment needed for work such as computer monitors or desk equipment. Others provide reimbursement for employees to use on office-related costs such as electricity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid and flexible work is a beneficial aspect of the modern workplace. Enabling alternate work models shows your employees you care about their work-life balance and trust them to do what&#8217;s best for their productivity. By establishing a clear policy about remote, flexible and hybrid work, you ensure both your employees and your business reap the rewards.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By creating standardized policies for the workplace, your organization can grow as an inclusive work environment, and join the ranks of the high-growth companies who are adapting hybrid work models and flexible workplace policies.
